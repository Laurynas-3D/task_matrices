## task_matrices

### Multiply two matrices, same size

Project contains two folders

:file_folder: Version201912
    - Very first task implementation / broken and obsolete 
    - Reason: code is too messy, logical mistake, horrible variable names, it is just too clunky
    
:file_folder: Version202001
    - Second approach of the same task
    - Goals: correct first version mistakes, make a much better version
