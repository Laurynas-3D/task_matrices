    /** TASK:
     * The task is to multiply 2D-matrices of square size in Java. You should show your skills of writing efficient
     * parallel code and knowledge of OOP practices.
     *
     * 1) Multiply 2 matrices of the same size. Let the size be in the range [1..10000].
     * 2) Use 0 and 1 as only allowed values in the matrix. Modulo 2 operation should be applied to all internal
     * "add" and "multiply" operations.
     * 3) You can use any of java version.
     * 4) Publish the project to Github git repository and provide us with a link.
     * 5) Prepare a main entry point which reads an unsigned integer number as input from console and executes
     * sequential and parallel versions of the algorithm and prints execution time to console of both of them.
